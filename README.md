## Our vision
The coronavirus is changing our world and our labour market. So if you have just lost your job or are only able to work in a limited way, you now have the chance to help out in areas where help is urgently needed.

## How did it start?

**Userflows**

To get a clear understanding of the requirements we built a userflow after the brainstorming. It quickly became clear to us that in 2 days we cannot concentrate on both sides, employer and employee. 

So we decided to start with the employee side. 

UserFlow Total - Version 1

We have also found that we want to make it as easy as possible for users to use the app and find out about possible jobs. That's why we have moved the registration to the back of the app.

**Wireframes**

After it was clear to us which requirements we had, we started with wireframes.

A more precise vision of how we envision the app, how certain features can work and look like. A user-centered design of the app was in the foreground for us.

**Design**

We have chosen friendly and serious colours. As font we use "Inter" by Rasmus Andersson.

Logo Design

Jay stands for "**J**obs **a**round **y**ou"

The word mark Jay is complemented by an iconographic jay.

## How we built it

The prototype consists of two parts: Backend & Frontend

Backend ([Github](https://github.com/getjay/getjay-backend)): 

* Node.js with Express
* Firebase
* PostgreSQL
* TypeScript

Frontend ([Github](https://github.com/getjay/getjay-frontend)): 

* Nuxt.js (Vue)
* Typescript
* Docker

Design:

* Figma


## Challenges we have encountered

Time, but this is quite normal at a Hackathon. ;-)

## What we have learned

That you can do wonderful things in a short time with people you did not know before.

## Achievements we are proud of

* Scope of the project - we try to help different people in different situations and sectors (e.g. not only harvest workers, but all people, from students to pensioners with different levels of education and work experience)
* Website Design
* Video
* App Prototyp

## What is next for JAY?

The app is currently a proof of concept and not a production-ready app. Of course there is still a lot to do. We have learned a lot through the development of the prototype what we want to include in the next concept and design iteration. We are also working on the topic of financing so that we can design and publish the app as soon as possible and help people.
